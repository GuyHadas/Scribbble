# Scribbble

[Scribbble][heroku] is a web application that allows the design community to give feedback throughout their design process. Inspired by Dribbble.com, Scribbble is built using Ruby on Rails and React.js.

## Scribbble Walk-through

### Scribbble Splash Page

![splash]
[splash]: ./screenshots/splash.png

Scribbble's home page layout is intended to immerse the visitor into the colorful and beautiful world that illustrates the work of Scribbble's community.

Scribbble handles secure user authentication and a demo account for quick accessibility to explore. Scribbble is a single-page application in which the root page renders the splash page when 'UserStore.currentUser()' returns nil, and renders the index page otherwise. Various error messages are easily accessible across components via the 'ErrorStore'.

Allowing for multiple sessions makes it a bug-free experience regardless of the amount of people using the demo account.

#### Various Authentication Code Snippets

```ruby
class Api::SessionsController < ApplicationController

  def create
    @user = User.find_by_credentials(params[:user][:username], params[:user][:password])
    if @user
      login_user!(@user)
      render :show
    else
      @errors = ["Invalid Username or Password"]
      render :show, status: 401
    end
  end

end

class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base

  def current_user
    return nil unless session[:session_token]
    @current_user ||= User.find_by(session_token: session[:session_token])
  end

  def login_user!(user)
    user.reset_session_token!
    session[:session_token] = user.session_token
  end

  def logout_user!
    if current_user
      current_user.reset_session_token!
    end
    session[:session_token] = nil
  end


end

class User < ActiveRecord::Base

  def self.generate_session_token
    SecureRandom.urlsafe_base64
  end

  def ensure_session_token
    self.session_token ||= self.class.generate_session_token
  end

  def reset_session_token!
    self.session_token = self.class.generate_session_token
    self.save!
    self.session_token
  end

  def password=(password)
    @password = password
    self.password_digest = BCrypt::Password.create(password)
  end

  def is_password?(password)
    BCrypt::Password.new(self.password_digest).is_password?(password)
  end

  def self.find_by_credentials(username, password)
    user = User.find_by(username: username)
    return nil if user.nil?
    user.is_password?(password) ? user : nil
  end

end

```

### Note Rendering and Editing

  On the database side, the notes are stored in one table in the database, which contains columns for `id`, `user_id`, `content`, and `updated_at`.  Upon login, an API call is made to the database which joins the user table and the note table on `user_id` and filters by the current user's `id`.  These notes are held in the `NoteStore` until the user's session is destroyed.  

  Notes are rendered in two different components: the `CondensedNote` components, which show the title and first few words of the note content, and the `ExpandedNote` components, which are editable and show all note text.  The `NoteIndex` renders all of the `CondensedNote`s as subcomponents, as well as one `ExpandedNote` component, which renders based on `NoteStore.selectedNote()`. The UI of the `NoteIndex` is taken directly from Evernote for a professional, clean look:

Note editing is implemented using the Quill.js library, allowing for a Word-processor-like user experience.

### Notebooks

Implementing Notebooks started with a notebook table in the database.  The `Notebook` table contains two columns: `title` and `id`.  Additionally, a `notebook_id` column was added to the `Note` table.  

The React component structure for notebooks mirrored that of notes: the `NotebookIndex` component renders a list of `CondensedNotebook`s as subcomponents, along with one `ExpandedNotebook`, kept track of by `NotebookStore.selectedNotebook()`.  

`NotebookIndex` render method:

```javascript
render: function () {
  return ({this.state.notebooks.map(function (notebook) {
    return <CondensedNotebook notebook={notebook} />
  }
  <ExpandedNotebook notebook={this.state.selectedNotebook} />)
}
```

### Tags

As with notebooks, tags are stored in the database through a `tag` table and a join table.  The `tag` table contains the columns `id` and `tag_name`.  The `tagged_notes` table is the associated join table, which contains three columns: `id`, `tag_id`, and `note_id`.  

Tags are maintained on the frontend in the `TagStore`.  Because creating, editing, and destroying notes can potentially affect `Tag` objects, the `NoteIndex` and the `NotebookIndex` both listen to the `TagStore`.  It was not necessary to create a `Tag` component, as tags are simply rendered as part of the individual `Note` components.

## Future Directions for the Project

In addition to the features already implemented, I plan to continue work on this project.  The next steps for FresherNote are outlined below.

### Search

Searching notes is a standard feature of Evernote.  I plan to utilize the Fuse.js library to create a fuzzy search of notes and notebooks.  This search will look go through tags, note titles, notebook titles, and note content.  

### Direct Messaging

Although this is less essential functionality, I also plan to implement messaging between FresherNote users.  To do this, I will use WebRTC so that notifications of messages happens seamlessly.
